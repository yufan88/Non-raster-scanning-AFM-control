m-th pixel: x_asix_location \t y_asix_location \t mu_path_length \t direction

% x_asix_location --- starting location of the i-th \mu path in x axis

% y_asix_location --- starting location of the i-th \mu path in y axis

% mu_path_length --- the length of the i-th \mu path

% direction --- the direction of the \mu path, 1 means it is a continuous scanning pattern, 2 means from left to right, 3 means from right to left, 4 means from top to bottom, 5 means from bottom to top
